## Slice 1.1 review — deferred low-severity cleanup (deferred 2026-06-17)

The PR #45 max-effort review fixed the four substantive items (Inspector `canFold`, honest
`foldedTokens`, empty-`replace`→digest, wire routed through `wireFoldable` — see
[view-wire-unification.md](view-wire-unification.md) "Slice 1.1"). These remaining findings are
low-severity (no lie, no reachable regression) and were deliberately deferred:

- **Alarm Layer 2's "on the wire but NOT in view" loop is dead code.** `wireSet` is always a
  subset of `viewSet` (`computeFoldOps` adds kind/durable/non-empty filters on top of the view's
  folded set), so that branch can never fire (`live/foldAlarm.svelte.ts`). Either drop it or
  fold it into a one-directional check + comment.
- **Alarm `$effect` over-subscribes + repeats O(n) passes.** It tracks every block reactive
  field (not just `store.version`) and, when live, walks the blocks for Layer 1, again for
  `viewSet`, and a third time inside `computeFoldOps` (which also allocates digest strings the
  alarm doesn't need). Merge Layer 1 + `viewSet` into one pass, build an id-only wire set, and
  short-circuit when `foldedCount === 0` (`+page.svelte` effect + `foldAlarm.svelte.ts`).
- **`inFoldedGroup` is defined twice.** `foldAlarm.svelte.ts`'s private helper re-derives
  `store.groupOf(b)?.folded`; the store owns the same predicate (used by `canFold`). Expose/reuse
  one.
- **Extract `store.canToggle(id)` (= `isFolded(b) || canFold(b)`).** The double-click guard is
  copy-pasted into both `ContextMap.svelte` handlers and spelled differently from the transcript
  button's `{#if folded || canFold}`.
- **CSS dedupe.** `@keyframes alarmpulse` is byte-identical to `livepulse`, and `.alarm-dot` ≈
  `.live-dot` (only color + duration differ) in `+page.svelte`. Share one `@keyframes pulse` and
  a `.status-dot` base with `--dot-color`/`--dot-duration`.
- **Dead "Unfold" for a collapsed folded-group member** (`ContextMap.svelte` transcript ~1082
  AND `Inspector.svelte` block + partner fold buttons): `folded`/`isFolded` is true so the
  control shows enabled, but `toggle`→`unfold` no-ops inside a folded group. Pre-existing in all
  three (also true under the old `{#if !prot}` / `disabled={protect}` gates); gate on
  `(folded && !inFoldedGroup) || canFold`, or route grouped members to `unfoldGroup`.
- **Hoist the conductor-visible foldable-kind set into the contract.** `cold-score.ts` and
  `cold-epoch.ts` each declare a private `FOLDABLE_KINDS`; with the honest-`foldedTokens` fix
  they no longer *need* it for the shrink decision, but a single `conductors/contract` export
  (consumed by the engine and every conductor) would make foldability truly single-sourced
  across the conductor boundary too. Touches the public conductor surface → its own small PR.
- **Property-test id fidelity.** `foldconsistency.property.test.ts`'s `durableId()` gives every
  assistant part a `:p0` suffix, so same-message-prefix logic (group/partner pairing) isn't
  exercised on realistic ids. Tighten the generator to emit per-message part indices.

## View ↔ wire unification — stricter "single source" finish (deferred 2026-06-16)

**Pointer, not the work.** Full design in
[docs/view-wire-unification.md](view-wire-unification.md).

The UI could lie: "what is folded" was computed twice (the store/view vs. the wire), with
different rules, so the screen could show a fold the agent never received (e.g. folding a
`tool_call`). The **near-term fix (Option A — one shared foldability predicate) and the
alarm** are being done now. **Deferred here is Option C — the single-source projection**:
make the wire projection the only place folded-state exists, so the store becomes a thin
view over it and divergence is *unrepresentable* rather than merely prevented.

**Do C only on a trigger:** the alarm actually fires in real use (proving the shared
predicate alone wasn't enough), OR the render layer is being reworked for another reason and
C can be folded in cheaply. Wide blast radius (every `isFolded`/`effTokens`/`digestOf` reader
across `ContextMap`/`MapHeader`/`Inspector`/transcript). A is the first half of C, so C lands
as a mechanical render-layer migration on top of an already-unified predicate. See the design
doc for specifics.

## Public launch: official website, installer flow, and pi extension distribution (pinned 2026-06-09)

**Goal:** bring Accordion from a local/dev tool to a polished public product that other pi
users can discover, install, understand, and use for their own sessions.

**Product outcome:** a user should be able to land on an official Accordion website,
understand what the app does, install the desktop app, install/enable the pi extension,
run `/accordion`, and see their own pi session live in the app without needing repo
knowledge.

**Scope:**

- **Official website**
  - Build a public landing/docs site for Accordion.
  - Explain the core idea: visual context map, folding, protected tail, live pi
    integration, read-only transcript browsing, and the unfold flow.
  - Include screenshots/GIFs/video of:
    - `/accordion` opening the app;
    - session sidebar;
    - context map;
    - folding/unfolding;
    - saved transcript browsing.
  - Provide clear install/setup instructions.
  - Include troubleshooting for:
    - app does not launch;
    - extension not loaded;
    - no live sessions visible;
    - Windows path/installer issues;
    - `ACCORDION_APP_PATH` / `--accordion-app`.

- **Installable desktop app**
  - Finalize release builds/installers for Windows first.
  - Verify installed executable layout matches `/accordion` launcher defaults.
  - Decide whether app binary should be `Accordion.exe` instead of `app.exe`.
  - Add signing/notarization plan as needed for public trust.
  - Define release artifact naming/versioning.

- **pi extension distribution**
  - Package the Accordion pi extension so users can install it as a pi extension/package,
    not by cloning the repo and manually pointing at `extension/accordion.ts`.
  - Document the install command and settings entry.
  - Decide whether app/extension protocol compatibility should be checked at runtime.
  - Make `/accordion` the primary affordance after install.

- **First-run/user onboarding**
  - If the app opens with no sessions, explain:
    - “Run `/accordion` inside pi.”
    - “Make sure the Accordion extension is installed/enabled.”
  - If the extension runs but the app is not installed/found, show actionable setup
    instructions.
  - Consider an in-app setup checklist.

- **Release/readiness polish**
  - Update README to point users to the website.
  - Add a changelog/release-notes path.
  - Confirm current app/extension protocol versioning is documented.
  - Add a smoke test or manual release checklist for:
    - fresh install;
    - `/accordion` launch;
    - single-instance focus;
    - live session attach;
    - fold/unfold round-trip;
    - saved transcript browsing.

**Likely sequence:**

1. Define public positioning and install story.
2. Stabilize Windows installer/output names.
3. Package/distribute the pi extension.
4. Build the website.
5. Add screenshots/demo assets.
6. Run fresh-machine install smoke.
7. Publish first public release.

**Open questions:**

- Is the website static docs/landing only, or should it also host downloads/releases?
- Where should binaries be hosted first: GitHub Releases, the website, or both?
- Should the public brand be “Accordion for pi” or just “Accordion”?
- Should app and extension ship together as one release, or be separately versioned?
- What is the minimum supported pi version?
- Do we want telemetry/update checks, or fully manual releases for now?

**Non-goals for first public launch:**

- Cloud sync.
- Hosted sessions.
- Multi-machine live attach.
- Browser-only runtime.
- Full macOS/Linux installer polish unless explicitly prioritized.

## Follow-up: harden `/accordion` app launch beyond Windows-first defaults (pinned 2026-06-08)

**Status:** the core one-step behavior is implemented: `/accordion` writes the existing
focus request, best-effort launches/reinvokes the Tauri desktop app when detached, and
the app uses single-instance behavior to focus an existing window instead of duplicating
it. The focus file remains the only session handoff, so the pull model is intact.

**Remaining follow-ups:**
- verify packaged Windows install paths once the installer name/layout is finalized;
- consider macOS/Linux default path searches if/when those builds are distributed;
- add deeper unit coverage for launcher path precedence and spawn-error reporting if the
  launcher grows beyond today's small helper.

**Deferred:** deep links (`accordion://`) and browser/Vite launch remain out of scope.

## Scale the tile grid beyond DOM — virtualize first, canvas/WebGL only if needed (pinned 2026-06-07)

**Goal:** keep the Map grid smooth as sessions grow past today's ~982 tiles. The grid
currently renders every block as its own DOM element; that's near the comfortable ceiling
for plain DOM, which is why `ContextMap.svelte` already carries a pile of repaint-avoidance
tricks (kill hover during scroll, cached dice SVGs, GPU layer promotion, no live gradients).
A 5–50k-tile session, or fluid pan/zoom, would outgrow that.

**Direction (cheapest first — do NOT jump straight to canvas):**
- **Virtualize the DOM** — only render the tiles actually on screen (windowed render keyed
  to scroll position). Smallest change; keeps everything the browser gives for free (hover,
  click, focus, the arrow-key cursor, `title` tooltips, CSS-var theming, accessibility,
  devtools). This is almost certainly enough and should be tried before anything heavier.
  Note: `content-visibility`/`contain-intrinsic-size` were already tried on `.cell` and
  **removed** (hurt more than helped) — so virtualization here means real windowing, not CSS
  containment.
- **Canvas / WebGL** — only if virtualization isn't enough (tens of thousands of tiles, or
  60fps pan/zoom). Paints all tiles onto one surface; scales hugely but you re-own what the
  browser did for free: hit-testing (which tile is under x,y — easy here since tiles are a
  uniform grid), hover/selection/cursor, tooltips, CSS-var theming (colors move into JS),
  accessibility (needs a parallel ARIA layer — the real cost), find-in-page/copy, and
  devicePixelRatio crispness. A **hybrid** (canvas tiles + a thin DOM overlay for the
  hovered/selected tile, tooltip, and a11y) recovers most of those losses.

**Helps that the tiles are uniform squares with no text** (dice pips are pre-baked SVG
data-URIs), so a canvas port sidesteps text rendering — the hardest part. The interaction
surface (hover, selection ring, arrow-key traversal, tooltips, the on-demand Inspector) is
what you'd be reimplementing.

**Loose end this would reconnect:** `AccordionStore.version` (`store.svelte.ts`) is bumped on
every settled change but currently has **zero readers** — it was added as a coarse "repaint
now" signal for exactly a canvas renderer. Today it's dead (the DOM grid self-updates via
Svelte). A canvas/WebGL view would subscribe to it; until then it's vestigial (delete it, or
relabel its comment as reserved — see the perf review that flagged it).

## Browse saved pi sessions like Claude Code transcripts (pinned 2026-06-05)

**Status/context:** browsable, read-only Claude Code transcript discovery has shipped: the
sidebar has a Claude Code source, Rust lists recent `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` files,
and the header/sidebar mark the view as **READ-ONLY**. The remaining adjacent idea is to
offer the same browse-don't-hunt flow for saved pi transcripts under
`~/.pi/agent/sessions`.

**Goal:** add a read-only saved-pi source/section to the Sessions sidebar. Selecting a row
loads the transcript through the existing parser and local fold/unfold/pin/peek lens, with
no live socket and no steering.
