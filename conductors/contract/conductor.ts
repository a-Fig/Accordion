/*
 * conductor.ts — the Accordion ↔ Conductor contract (ADR 0007).
 *
 * A "conductor" is an interchangeable context-management strategy. Conductors are
 * first-party — they ship in this repo (or a fork). The default is the built-in
 * auto-folder (`../builtin/builtin.ts`); anyone adds another — in-process (the main
 * way) or, as an escape hatch, over a WebSocket in any language — and it speaks the
 * SAME vocabulary, defined here. There is no third party and no trust boundary.
 *
 * The whole contract is the in-process shape of one pure idea:
 *
 *     conduct(view) → Command[]
 *
 * The host hands the conductor a read-only VIEW of the context; the conductor replies
 * with COMMANDS describing the context it wants. The host clamps those commands to the
 * one floor it enforces — provider-validity, "the message must always stay sendable" —
 * applies them, and reports back anything it had to clamp.
 *
 * The `ConductorView` below is the ONE public surface every conductor consumes — the
 * built-in folder included. It is pure, serializable data: identical in-process and on
 * the wire (`conductorProtocol.ts` carries the very same `ViewBlock`s). The built-in is
 * therefore the worked example, programmed against exactly the surface anyone else gets;
 * there is no privileged richer input. That is the whole point of this module.
 *
 * This module is deliberately dependency-free and runes-free — it imports NOTHING from
 * the engine, so the kind union is defined locally. It must be importable by the engine,
 * by the live wire layer, and — via the shared `conductorProtocol.ts` — by an
 * out-of-process conductor. Keep it that way: no Svelte, no `$state`, no Node/Tauri APIs.
